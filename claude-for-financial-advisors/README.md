# Claude for Financial Advisors

A plugin from Anthropic that gives financial advisors a set of ready-to-run workflows for Claude Cowork that draw live data from the tools their firm already uses, by way of third-party connectors.

The plugin is a set of skills written as plain instructions (Markdown and JSON). It holds no client data: when an advisor runs a skill, Claude pulls what it needs from the connected third-party systems. The advisor must explicitly approve any action that writes back to an external system (e.g. CRM updates, client drafts). Claude gathers, organizes, summarizes, compares and presents information, while the advisor exercises judgment, makes the recommendation and gives the advice.

Educational and operational support for advisors; not investment, legal, or tax advice.

**Maintenance status:** Reference implementation. Not actively maintained or monitored, and not accepting contributions. Issues and pull requests may not receive a response. This project is provided AS IS, without warranty.

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
| :---- | :---- |
| `/onboarding` | Guided first-run setup: learns the advisor's firm, priorities, and tech stack, then connects their tools and runs a sample demo. |
| `/pre-meeting` | Builds a client review prep doc \- snapshot, relationship signals, open items, portfolio review, planning topics, agenda, talking points. |
| `/post-meeting` | Turns a meeting artifact or transcript into a CRM note. |
| `/compliance` | Pre-checks client-facing material against SEC Marketing Rule, antifraud, books-and-records, and Reg BI; produces a findings table, suggested disclosures, and a clean redraft. |
| `/prospect-intake` | Normalizes a prospect's statements into a summary, an analyst handoff, and a what-to-expect memo. |
| `/portfolio-rebalance-review` | Reviews performance, drift vs. IPS or model, and model mapping; lays out tax-aware rebalance scenarios for the advisor to evaluate, and drafts a memo documenting the advisor’s rationale. |
| `/alts-brief` | Meeting-ready read on a household's alternative investments sized against the liquid book. |
| `/estate-and-tax-brief` | Cross-checks the estate plan against actual account titling and beneficiaries; prior-year tax look-back; optional CRM follow-up tasks. |

Each skill pulls from whichever connectors are live and falls back to paste/upload when a system isn't connected. Every write to a client system pauses for advisor approval.

## Connectors

| Connector | What it does |
| :---- | :---- |
| Addepar | Brings investment intelligence into Claude, giving advisors governed access to portfolio data, analytics and workflows across public and private markets. |
| BlackRock | Brings Advisor Center’s portfolio analytics, model portfolios, and investment research resources to advisors through Claude. |
| Envestnet Tamarac | Brings portfolio and performance reporting, including reconciliation status, from Tamarac into Claude so that advisors can conduct household reviews, drift checks, and meeting prep. |
| iCapital | Brings a client’s alternatives book into Claude, with holdings and performance across private funds, so advisors can see NAV against commitments, unfunded capital, recent calls, and distributions alongside the liquid portfolio. |
| MoneyGuide | Brings a household's financial plan into Claude — net worth, probability of success, and goals. |
| Orion Advisor Solutions | Brings portfolio and performance reporting from Orion Connect, and client records from Redtail CRM, into Claude so that advisors can conduct household reviews, drift checks, and meeting prep. |
| Wealthbox | Connects Claude to client records and meeting history to power onboarding, meeting prep, and follow-up. |
| Wealth.com | Gives Claude a structured view of each client’s estate plan, including trust and will summaries, and the full balance sheet, so advisors can begin document review using an organized summary of available information instead of a binder full of documents. |
| Zocks | Brings Claude the client intelligence it captures from every conversation, including profiles, goals, life events, and commitments. |
| Schwab *(coming soon)* | Custodial account, titling, and beneficiary data for the estate and rebalance reviews. The connector is not yet available; skills that reference Schwab note that and fall back to paste or upload until it lands. |

These join other connectors already available in Claude, including Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Box, FactSet, S\&P Global, Morningstar, and more.

## Contributing

This repo is not actively monitored (see the maintenance status above). [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how the plugin is put together and the design rules to keep if you fork or adapt it, plus the CLA requirement in case a pull request is ever reviewed.

## Security

To report a security vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Security considerations.** The skills and agents here are instructions, not code, so the guardrails they describe (advisor approval before any write, read-only subagents, arithmetic in a shell that never sees document text) are enforced by the model following them, not by the runtime. Subagents read content from third parties: prospect statements, client emails, CRM notes, testimonials. Treat that content as untrusted. If you adapt these agents, keep the read-only and shell rules in place, prefer connectors that expose read-only tools, and do not widen any agent's tool list without reviewing what it ingests.
